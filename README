just do 'make' to have stuff done.

then execute the output binary to cli help. it's simple, both encrypt and
decrypt are done by the same binary.

the example files are:
    - file.txt: plain text

    - file.txt.enc: same but encrypted with password 'password' as
      follows:
        `cat file.txt | ./encrypt password > file.txt.enc`

    - file.txt.enc.txt: same but decrypted with password 'password' as
      follows:
        `cat file.txt.enc | ./encrypt password > file.txt.enc.txt`

known issues:
    - random(3) is not cryptographically secure. replace it
      by a cryptographically secure alternative.

    - the tool does not automatically generate an initialization
      vector (iv) which is silly. it's simple to add but i didn't
      cause this wasn't worth more than 10 minutes of coding.

known fixes:
    - replace random(3) by a better one with more entropy.
    - add iv to the implementation. of, if lazy, simply append it to
      your password. but if you append it to your password then you'll
      have to do your own house keeping which sucks.

why this?
    was sort of bored.
